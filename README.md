# src-pdf
I was inspired to do this because I am having a hard time reading linux source code 
on the vim, so I write this program to generate all source code to a pdf file.

The pdf file will be generated in LaTeX. User should have installed miktex.

TODO:
- Writing a configure file to help user install the miktex (if user doesn't have it)
- Adding a feature of reading the README file (author, copyright, project name, etc.)
